# Boba Buddies
Boba Buddies is a mini video game created by Maggie Luo and Celena Chang during the final two weeks of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Square Inc. in 2015. The goal of the game is to have the four Boba Buddies jump over as many trash cans as possible on their way home from the Boba Shop.

We'd like to thank our Girls Who Code instructors Vidya Ganapati and Sabra Daqiq for tirelessly helping us with our code throughout the program, and for teaching us the basic skills needed to get started in computer science. Your passion and dedication to us has sparked a love for computer science that continue to motivate us as we begin our studies at UC Berkeley.
